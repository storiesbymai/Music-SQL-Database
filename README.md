# Music SQL Database
 Udacity SQL Project - 'Query a Digital Music Store Database'
I completed this SQL project for my Udacity Business Analytics nanodegree program. We were asked to assess a music database to optimize a company's business practices and create a presentation that included:
* four slides
* one visualization per slide
* 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
* the SQL query used the create the data used in the visualization

## Queries
Each query used had to satisfy the following criteria:
* run without errors and produce intended results
* include one or more explicit join(s) that answer the question proposed
* include one or more aggregation(s) - COUNT, AVG, SUM, etc.
* at least four unique SQL queries
